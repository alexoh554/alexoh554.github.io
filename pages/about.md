My name is Alex Oh and I am currently studying in the Computer Engineering program at the University of Waterloo. I am interested in many topics such as Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Computer Firmware. I’m deeply fascinated by how technology shapes the world, and I’m always eager to learn and take on new challenges.

Growing up in various Canadian cities - Coquitlam, Calgary, Vancouver, and finally Richmond, BC - I discovered my love for computer programming during my high school years. The COVID-19 pandemic provided me with extra time, which I used to enroll in [Harvard’s online CS50 course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science). This was a transformative experience that sparked my passion for the problem-solving side of programming.

During high school, I immersed myself in online resources — courses, textbooks, and YouTube tutorials — to build my skills and knowledge. My efforts were driven by a long-term goal of joining Waterloo Engineering. Today, in my Computer Engineering classes, I am exploring everything from operating systems to embedded microprocessors.

I’ve also gained valuable industry experience through three co-ops/internships:
- Software Developer Intern @ [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ca/business.html)
- AI/ML Engineering Intern @ [Eon Media](https://eonmedia.ai/) 
- Software Developer Intern @ [Escape](https://www.esc-ape.ca/)

These roles have expanded my technical expertise and given me insight into industry practices and my own interests. One thing I’ve discovered is my love for documentation — I enjoy helping others understand the *what*, *why*, and *how* of my work. I use this blog to document my learning and share my thought processes.

Outside of tech, my interests are hockey, combat sports, and fitness. In my free time, I like to play the guitar or practice muay thai.
