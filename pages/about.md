My name is Alex Oh and I am currently studying in the Computer Engineering program at the University of Waterloo. I am interested in many topics including Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Computer Hardware. Technology is my passion and I am always learning new things!

Outside of tech, my interests are hockey, combat sports, and fitness. In my free time, I like to play the guitar or practice muay thai.

I use the blog to document my learning and share my thought process when working on my projects.
